# U.S. Citizenship Civics Practice Quiz (2025 Revised Test)

## PROOF OF CONCEPT
This quiz is just a simple proof of concept and should not be used for studying or taking the 2005 U.S. Citizenship test. 

I created it in response to Washington Post article: Can you pass the new U.S. citizenship test?

## üöÄ Hosting and Setup

Since this is a fully contained front-end application, the easiest way to host it is using **GitHub Pages**.

### 1. Repository Setup (Bash/Terminal)

Assuming you have `git` installed and your project folder (`citizenship-quiz`) is ready:

```bash
# Initialize Git in your local folder
git init

# Add the main quiz file
git add index.html

# Commit the changes (using your private GitHub noreply email)
git commit -m "Initial commit of the complete civics quiz"

# Add the remote link (use your SSH URL for better security/convenience)
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/citizenship-quiz.git

# Push the code to the 'main' branch on GitHub
git push --set-upstream origin main
